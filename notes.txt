*If any restriction about the driver (about being public) , we can use local driver object but we have to change
* driver class

 WebDriver driver ;

    @Test
    public void name() {

        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","/Users/mac/IdeaProjects/CucumberFramework/chromedriver");

        WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();

        driver.get("http://google.com")   ;

    }
